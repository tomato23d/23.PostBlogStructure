# NoSQL: Social Network API


## Background

As a junior developer, I would like a simple and workable solution to store and retrieve the data for the Social Network application I write.


## Technical setup

MongoDB is setup to store the data posted. Data API are created within NPM express and NPM mongoose repository. 

Data API are tested in Insomina and MongoDB Compass. 


## Validation

Screencastify videos have been recorded to showcase the logic of API. 

User routes video: (https://drive.google.com/file/d/13Mzgoav4QVki0c5SBIh0hQA2nY4C7zLn/view).


Thoughts and reactions routes video: (https://drive.google.com/file/d/1madh-RCoo0fhSh3CK0Ygikh07HyyBf3V/view).

All names and statements (thoughts and reactions) in this project are fictitious.

The detailed explanation for each route is also available if necessary to grade this assignment.
